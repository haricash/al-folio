I am currently a project assistant at the TU Wien, working in the Theory of Living Matter Group. My main research interests are in understanding complex mesoscale systems, from micro-organisms to society using ideas from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics. I will soon start as a PhD student in the same group working on emergent behaviour in the locomotion of ciliated microorganisms.

I spent most of my undergrad worrying about astronomy and astrophysics. I've mentioned some of these projects in my projects page.

Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy trekking, climbing, quizzing and reading history and philosophy. I occasionally jam music and am an outdoorsy person, always seeking thrill and adventure!

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in physics at IISER Pune. Broadly speaking, my research interests are in formation and evolution of galaxies, and their halo connection. 

I am also interested in exploring novel statistical techniques for parameter estimation and recovery in astronomy and cosmology. I have worked with Bayesian inference using MCMC and machine learning, and am currently exploring probabilistic Bayesian neural networks - they're the best of both worlds!

I am working towards my Master's thesis under the guidance of Dr. Yogesh Wadadekar at NCRA-TIFR, where we are using the SDSS-MaNGA spectroscopic data in conjunction with HSC-SSP deep fields to understand the impact of environmental and secular properties on galaxy evolution.

I am also working on a project with Dr. Tirthankar Roy Choudhury to extend the current work on astronomical parameter estimation of ionized bubbles in the simulated 21 cm field from z~7.

I am deeply passionate about problems that can be solved using data. I specifically enjoy worrying about problems related to climate science and agriculture.

Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy trekking, quizzing and reading history. I occasionally jam music and am an outdoorsy person, always seeking thrill and adventure!

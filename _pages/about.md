I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in physics at IISER Pune. My research interests are broadly in data driven astronomy and structure formation in cosmology. My interests also lie in studying human scale systems on the Earth, and am currently learning non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and its applications in biological systems.

Most of my time is spent working on my master's thesis under the guidance of <a href='http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~yogesh/'>Dr. Yogesh Wadadekar</a> at <a href='http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main'>NCRA-TIFR</a>. Our goal is to identify statistical correlations between galaxy property distributions, as well as identify outlier populations in large datasets. One approach we are taking for identifying outlier populations is <a href='https://blog.paperspace.com/few-shot-learning/'>few shot learning</a>, where we are using pretrained models and a support set of galaxy examples from the known outlier samples to identify more of these in the larger dataset. Currently, we are using prototypical networks for this problem, and are experimenting with <a href='https://machinelearningmastery.com/meta-learning-in-machine-learning/'>meta learning</a> to identify red geyser populations from the MaNGA dataset.

Another project I am involved in is with <a href='http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~tirth/'>Dr. Tirthankar Roy Choudhury</a> to distinguish between different ionizing sources that led to the reionization of the universe. We are trying to infer this information from visibility maps using nested sampling and deep learning techniques.


Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy trekking, quizzing and reading history and philosophy. I occasionally jam music and am an outdoorsy person, always seeking thrill and adventure!
